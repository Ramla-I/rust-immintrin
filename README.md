# immintrin

This crate implements the names defined by Intel for SIMD and related instructions on x86
(functions with an `_mm_` prefix). These are useful for porting code, and because people
are familiar with them.  See https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1639 for discussion.

Currently contains signatures for all SSE/SSE2/SSE2/SSSE3 intrinsics, but only some are
implemented; this crate is a work in progress. Requires a nightly compiler for SIMD and
various unstable intrinsics.
